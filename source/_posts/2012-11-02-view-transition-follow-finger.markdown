I use [Prismatic](http://getprismatic.com/) as my main reading tool on iphone. I find the view transition of the app is very intresting(you can have a try [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/prismatic-always-interesting/id551206444?mt=8)), that i want to know how it does. By google, i find a [blog](http://iappexperience.com/post/23551184719/chromeless) and you can get the [source code](https://github.com/dyang/DYNavigationController). With the demo you can swipe the ui to transition, but can't let the transition follows your finger. So i decide to write a demo myself.

I put my code on [github](https://github.com/hermitinhistory/FollowFinger), and you can get the most explanation from the blog above.

Finally, big thanks to the author of the blog.
